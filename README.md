# Digit Number Classification
In this assignment, the main objective is to classify digit numbers using a neural network. The MINST dataset is utilized for training and evaluation purposes. The performance and evaluation of the neural network are compared by employing different preprocessing techniques on the input images. This exercise emphasizes the significance of preprocessing methods covered in the course.

# Segmentation Exercises
This folder includes exercises focused on image segmentation. The tasks encompass segmenting images based on specific criteria, such as counting the number of teeth in a wheel or segmenting multiple coffee grains and distinguishing each grain. These exercises provide practical experience in implementing segmentation algorithms and understanding their applications.

# Presentation
In the presentation section, a specific topic related to computer vision was chosen. A paper was selected for study, and efforts were made to understand and potentially develop a solution based on the paper's findings. The chosen topic for this assignment is semantic segmentation to detect regions containing clothes, skin, hair, and the background in images of people. A presentation with slides and a comprehensive report were prepared and submitted to demonstrate the knowledge gained from studying the selected topic.
